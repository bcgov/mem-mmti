  <p class="tab-intro">Compliance and enforcement (C&E) activities begin after a claim is staked and continue through exploration and the life of a mine. The Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), Ministry of Environment (ENV) and Environmental Assessment Office (EAO) work together to provide integrated oversight of British Columbiaâ€™s mining sector. Records of inspections conducted during the 2016 calendar year can be found below.
